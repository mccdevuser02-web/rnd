            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>Water is essential for survival. The human body can only survive 3-5 days without water, making it the top priority in any survival situation.</p>
                
                <h3>Identifying Water Sources</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Natural sources:</strong> Streams, rivers, lakes, and springs are your best options</li>
                    <li><strong>Plant sources:</strong> Cacti, bamboo, and certain plants contain water</li>
                    <li><strong>Atmospheric moisture:</strong> Collect dew from grass or use condensation techniques</li>
                    <li><strong>Animal tracks:</strong> Follow animal trails to find water sources</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>TIP: Water Detection Techniques</h4>
                    <p>Look for dark green vegetation, which indicates nearby water. Listen for sounds of flowing water. In desert environments, look for dry riverbeds that may contain hidden water sources.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Water Collection Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct collection:</strong> Use containers or natural vessels like large leaves</li>
                    <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Create a solar still using plastic sheeting and a container</li>
                    <li><strong>Dew collection:</strong> Use cloth to absorb dew from grass in the morning</li>
                    <li><strong>Plant extraction:</strong> Cut into plants like cacti or bamboo to extract moisture</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>TIP: Solar Still Construction</h4>
                    <p>Dig a hole in the ground, place a container in the center, and cover with plastic. Create a small mound over the container to form a funnel. The sun will evaporate water, which condenses on the plastic and drips into the container.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Water Purification</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> Most effective method - boil for at least 1 minute (3 minutes at high altitudes)</li>
                    <li><strong>Solar disinfection:</strong> Place water in clear plastic bottles and expose to sunlight for 6+ hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Charcoal filtration:</strong> Use charcoal from a fire to filter water through layers of sand and cloth</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical treatment:</strong> Iodine tablets or chlorine dioxide drops (if available)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>TIP: Water Storage Tips</h4>
                    <p>Store water in clean, sealed containers. Avoid plastic bottles that may leach chemicals. Glass or stainless steel containers are ideal. Keep water away from direct sunlight to prevent bacterial growth.</p>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>Story: The Desert Journey</strong></p>
                    <p>When Sarah's hiking group got lost in the Sonoran Desert, they had only one small water bottle between them. Following her survival training, she identified a dry riverbed that led to a hidden spring. Using her knowledge of solar stills, she created a second water source from dew collection. Her preparation and understanding of water sources saved the group's lives.</p>

            <h2><i class="material-icons icon">fireplace</i> MAKING FIRE</h2>
            
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>Fire provides warmth, protection from predators, cooking capabilities, and psychological comfort. Mastering fire-making techniques is crucial for survival.</p>
                
                <h3>Fire-Making Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Friction methods:</strong> Bow drill, hand drill, and fire plow</li>
                    <li><strong>Spark generation:</strong> Flint and steel, striker stones, or modern matches</li>
                    <li><strong>Concentrated sunlight:</strong> Magnifying glass or lens to focus sun rays</li>
                    <li><strong>Chemical reactions:</strong> Potassium permanganate with glycerin or other combinations</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>TIP: Bow Drill Technique</h4>
                    <p>The bow drill requires a wooden bow, drill, fire board, and tinder bundle. The bow should be about 3 feet long with a tight string. The drill should be straight and about 18 inches long. Apply steady pressure while rotating the drill to create friction and ember.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Fire Preparation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gather materials:</strong> Tinder (dry grass, bark, or wood fibers), kindling (small twigs), and fuel wood (larger logs)</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a fire bed:</strong> Clear area of debris and arrange materials in a teepee shape</li>
                    <li><strong>Choose location:</strong> Wind-protected area away from flammable vegetation</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare for safety:</strong> Have water or dirt nearby to extinguish the fire if needed</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>TIP: Tinder Preparation</h4>
                    <p>Use materials that ignite easily like dry grass, birch bark, or char cloth. Create a small pile of tinder and place it in your fire bed. The key is to create a small, concentrated flame that can catch larger pieces of kindling.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Fire Maintenance</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep fuel ready:</strong> Have a supply of dry wood nearby</li>
                    <li><strong>Control airflow:</strong> Use your hands or a small shield to control the fire's intensity</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitor for danger:</strong> Watch for sparks that could start new fires</li>
                    <li><strong>Extinguish properly:</strong> Douse with water or cover with dirt when finished</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>TIP: Fire Safety</h4>
                    <p>Never leave a fire unattended. Keep a bucket of water or dirt nearby. Clear the area around your fire of any flammable materials. Always check that the fire is completely extinguished before leaving.</p>

                    <p>During a winter storm, a group of climbers became trapped on a mountain. Their only source of warmth was a small emergency fire. Using their knowledge of friction methods and proper tinder preparation, they managed to maintain a fire for 36 hours until rescue arrived.

            <h2><i class="material-icons icon">home</i> SHELTER CONSTRUCTION</h2>
            
            <div class="chapter-content">
                <p>Shelter protects against weather elements, provides security, and conserves body heat. A well-constructed shelter can mean the difference between life and death in harsh conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>Shelter Types</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lean-to:</strong> Simple structure using a central support and angled roof</li>
                    <li><strong>A-Frame:</strong> Two poles forming an A-shape with a thatched roof</li>
                    <li><strong>Deer Lean:</strong> Shelter built against a large tree or rock</li>
                    <li><strong>Insulated dome:</strong> Circular structure using multiple layers for warmth</li>

                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>TIP: Shelter Location Selection</h4>
                    <p>Choose a location that is elevated, dry, and protected from wind. Avoid areas prone to flooding or where falling debris might occur. Look for natural windbreaks like large rocks or trees.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Materials Needed</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Roof covering:</strong> Leaves, grass, bark, or waterproof materials</li>
                    <li><strong>Insulation:</strong> Dry leaves, moss, or other natural insulators</li>
                    <li><strong>Foundation:</strong> Raised floor to keep out moisture and insects</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>TIP: Insulation Techniques</h4>
                    <p>Layer insulation materials with the densest material on the inside. Use dry leaves, moss, or bark for effective insulation. Create a small air pocket between the shelter and the ground to prevent heat loss.</p>
